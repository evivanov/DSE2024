# Materials for DSE 2024: Kim Ruhl

**Status:** (8/7/2024) Readings and slides are posted. Code is still in the works...

Lecture 13 // Thursday, August 8 // 13:00&ndash;14:20

Hello! This repo will (eventually) contain all of the materials related to my presentation. 

## Readings
The lecture is largely based around Alessandria, Arkolakis, and Ruhl (*Annual Review of Economics*, 2021). It provides an overview of how models of firm dynamics are used in international trade/macro. 

I have also added Alessandria, Choi, and Ruhl (*Journal of International Economics*, 2021) which provides a more in-depth study of the aggregate implications of modeling firms in international trade. We will not cover this in the presentation, but you might find it useful. 

Readings can be found in the "readings" folder in this repo.

## Slides
I have uploaded a draft of the slides (8/7/2024). I will likely make small updates to it before the presentation. I will upload the latest version before lunch on Thursday. 

## Code
I am fortunate to have [Xing Xu](https://github.com/2xu2) working with me on various projects. He is putting together some jupyter notebooks (in Julia) that walk us through some of the models. This code will be available in the "code" folder in this repo.
